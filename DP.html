    <h1>Drone Porteur</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Our project is titled 'Carrier Drone,' a project that aims to make the necessary modifications to the DJI Matrice 300 to 
      allow it to carry smaller drones, such as the DJI Mini 3 or the DJI Tello Edu, underneath it. A rewriting of the project 
      was done during the initial reports, and can be presented as follows: The objective is to have the Matrice 300 take off 
      with several smaller drones like the Tello Edu. To achieve this, we need to design a cradle/basket attached to the Matrice 300 
      on which we can attach the smaller drones. Once the takeoff is complete, we must be able to initiate an in-flight release 
      of the small drones from the Matrice 300, without interrupting its flight. Once released, the Tello Edu drones begin their 
      flight, engage in a predefined mission, and start their landing. We can list a couple milestones here :
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First is studying the drones APIs in order to effectively control and move the drones.</li>
        <li>We then need to make the different parts and PCBs to assemble them for the basket and the drone. </li>
        <li>After designing and check the PCBs are functional, making all everything communicate with eachother was essential.</li>
        <li>Once all the previous steps were completed, we then could start making functional takeoffs, drone realeses and landings.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      This project was part of our final evaluation during the second semester of the Master 2 ASPIC program. This graduation project revolved 
      around two main courses: MOCPI and PFE. The first course focused on the various aspects of organization within the work industry, including 
      making code readable and clean, dividing tasks among group members, and so onâ€”essentially, the project's format. The second course, in contrast, 
      focused on the project's content. For this course, we needed to hold meetings with the client, implement the desired functionalities, and, most 
      importantly, demonstrate results.

    <h2>Development</h2>
      <h3>Electronic Parts</h3>
      <p>
        Regarding the equipment needed, this equipment would need to control up to four servo motors controlling the grabbing system on the basket. 
        Therefore, we decided to use two main electronic components: a Pi Pico RP2040 and a Pi Zero 2W. First, we'd need the Pi Zero 2W to provide a 
        visual interface for displaying results, offer good support for potential users, and provide effective feedback during operation. This module 
        will be used for WiFi communication between the carrying basket and the drones loaded onto it. However, we encountered a problem: the Pi Zero 
        cannot control the grabbing system because it lacks the ability to send PWM signals to control the servos. Consequently, we realized we needed 
        a second module capable of communicating with them. This module is the Pi Pico RP2040, mounted on the basket. This simple module was sufficient 
        for controlling the servos, and it communicates with the Pi Zero via Serial.

      <p>
      During the project, we decided to design our own PCBs in order to not have a handmade circuit with wires everywhere mounted on the Matrice300.
      All the design were made on the software KICAD and the different attemps and designs were ordered on the website JLBPCB. the components are 
      soldered using 'reflow soldering' techniques. This involves heating the entire PCB according to a temperature curve to control the melting 
      of the tin and flux. The components are placed in their positions before the tin melts and correctly reposition themselves as the tin melts. 
      The PCB is then cooled according to a curve to prevent subjecting the tin, PCB, and components to sudden temperature changes. Electronic 
      components are very sensitive to temperature variations, and failure to adhere to the temperature curves specified by the manufacturers can 
      lead to unpredictable behavior. The PCB is cleaned, and through-hole technology (THT) components and connectors are soldered. See above an
      exemple of our PCB once finished.
      </p>

      <h3>3D Parts Designing</h3>
      <p>
        Several different parts had to be designed for the project to function. Over the weeks, we explored various approaches for creating the 
        carrying basket, the grabbing system, and the drone adapters. All of these designs were created using Fusion 360 software and 3D printed 
        at home with FDM printers and PLA+ filament.

      <h3>Drones implementation</h3>
      <p>The core of the project is the usage of drones. One drone will have the carrier role and the other one the carried role. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first drone used was the DJI Matrice300, which will have the carrier role. This drone will be controlled manually by a pilot as
          it carries the other smaller drone and the carrying basket.
        </li>
        <li>The second drone we'll mention is the DJI Mini3, the first carried drone we worked on. After some research and work, we quickly realised
          that the recent DJI APIs didn't support this drone, and everything available online was in "testing". We still managed to design
          an Android application mimicing the control joysticks, and retrieve and video stream from the drone. The work on this drone was then
          dropped.
        </li>
        <li>Lastly, the carried drone we kept for the project was the DJI Tello Edu. A much simpler drone to work on, firstly because less recent
          means more documentation online, and we could work on it with Python, which was impossible with the Mini3. We managed to make available
          API work, and fully control the Tello Edu.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results and Demonstration</h2>
      <p>All the objectives for the project were completed and the client was very satisfied with the work. We managed to fully control the DJI Tello Edu,
        design all the needed parts and components for the Matrice300 and its carrying basket, as well as making complete demonstrations of the work.

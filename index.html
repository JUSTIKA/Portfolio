              <P>I am a student in Computer Science at Universit√© de Bordeaux, currently<br> in my second year of Master's degree.
              Specialised in <b>Autonomous<br> Systems</b>, Perception Interaction and Control, I am passionate about robotics,<br> electronics, artificial intelligence and evolving technologies in general.<br>
              And actively <b>looking for a job opportunity</b> in these fields.<br></P>
              <P>From a young age, I've always been eager to experiment, discover<br> and try out new technologies, which led me to study computer science.<br>
              I consider myself a <b>serious</b> and <b>hardworking</b> person, and going forward<br>
              when the moment of chosing the Master's degree came, my interest in<br> <b>robotics</b> and the <b>challenges</b> this evolving field have to offer, made me<br>
              choose the Autonomous Systems, Perception Interaction and Control<br> specialisation.<br></P>
              <P>
                I am currently looking for a <b>job opportunity</b> in the field of <b>robotics</b>, <b>drones</b>, <br>
                and the development of <b>autonomous systems</b> in general. I am very<br>
                excited to learn and work on a profesionnal level surrounded by<br>
                experienced people in the field, giving me opportunities to grow and<br>
                develop my skills.<br>

              In a group of three students, for our Master 2 <b>graduation project</b>,<br>
              we took on the "Drone Porteur" subject. The goal was to<br> create a solution
              in order to <b>setup</b> a small drone on a bigger one,<br> and 
              when it's up in the air initiate a <b>drop sequence</b>. Once <br>
              it's done, it will start its mission autonomously and<br>
              land when completed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several <b>technical skills</b> were required for the project,<br>
              for exemple CAD design, electonics knowledge, study of<br>
              different APIs in order to make the drones move and<br>
              function etc. All the goals were completed in<br>
              a little more than two months of work.

              What's the <b>RoboCup</b> ? It's a robotics competition<br>
              where teams face eachother trying to complete<br>
              a set of <b>challenges</b>, and <b>innovate</b> in different<br>
              categories such as Soccer, Home, Rescue<br>and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our case, our team of three students were<br>
              tasked to solve the <b>Vision BlackOut</b> challenge<br>
              in the Soccer SSL category. Usually the robots playing <br>
              are controlled by a camera system, but in this<br>
              challenge, the camera system is disabled and the<br>
              robots must play using only their <b>sensors</b> (camera).<br>

              First Bot is a project made in collaboration with<br>
              the Einserb MatMeca Engeneering School. The goal<br>
              of the project is to create a <b>robot</b> that can<br>
              follow a <b>line</b> on the ground, and avoid obstacles.<br>
              In our case, we had two lines to follow, one red line<br>
              and one black line.
            </p>
            <p>
              We had the necessary material given to us such as<br> 
              a motor, a camera, a raspberry pi and more. Other<br>
              challenges we had to this project were kinematics<br>
              and odometry of the robot.

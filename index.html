              <P>I am a student in Computer Science at Universit√© de Bordeaux, currently<br> in my second year of Master's degree.
              Specialised in <b>Autonomous<br> Systems</b>, Perception Interaction and Control, I am passionate about robotics,<br> electronics, artificial intelligence and evolving technologies in general.<br>
              And actively <b>looking for an internship</b> in these fields.<br></P>
              <P>From a young age, I've always been eager to experiment, discover<br> and try out new technologies, which led me to study computer science.<br>
              I consider myself a <b>serious</b> and <b>hardworking</b> person, and going forward<br>
              when the moment of chosing the Master's degree came, my interest in<br> <b>robotics</b> and the <b>challenges</b> this evolving field have to offer, made me<br>
              choose the Autonomous Systems, Perception Interaction and Control<br> specialisation.<br></P>
              <P>
                I am currently looking for an internship in the field of robotics, drones, <br>
                and the development of autonomous systems in general. I am very<br>
                excited to learn and work on a profesionnal level surrounded by<br>
                experienced people in the field, giving me opportunities to grow and<br>
                develop my skills.<br>
              </P>  
              <P>
                And when I'm not working or studying, I like to spend my time<br>
                playing and coaching people on video games, watching movies<br>
                with my family, workout at the gym and go out with friends.<br>

            <p>
              What's the <b>RoboCup</b> ? It's a robotics competition<br>
              where teams face eachother trying to complete<br>
              a set of <b>challenges</b>, and <b>innovate</b> in different<br>
              categories such as Soccer, Home, Rescue<br>and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our case, our team of three students were<br>
              tasked to solve the <b>Vision BlackOut</b> challenge<br>
              in the Soccer SSL category. Usually the robots playing <br>
              are controlled by a camera system, but in this<br>
              challenge, the camera system is disabled and the<br>
              robots must play using only their <b>sensors</b> (camera).<br>
            </p>

            <h2><a href="/Portfolio/firstbot.html">First Bot - <i>2024</i></a></h2>
            <p>
              First Bot is a project made in collaboration with<br>
              the Einserb MatMeca Engeneering School. The goal<br>
              of the project is to create a <b>robot</b> that can<br>
              follow a <b>line</b> on the ground, and avoid obstacles.<br>
              In our case, we had two lines to follow, one red line<br>
              and one black line.
            </p>
            <p>
              We had the necessary material given to us such as<br> 
              a motor, a camera, a raspberry pi and more. Other<br>
              challenges we had to this project were kinematics<br>
              and odometry of the robot.
